# Sass Boilerplate

Just some boilerplate to get started on a project with lite-server and node-sass.

I got tired of having to generate a new package.json file, install the requisite modules and other such boilerplate to start working on a website. So I've created this git.

# Instructions.

1) Clone into your working directory with 'git@github.com:tdmnew/sassboilerplate.git'
2) Run 'NPM Install' to generate the node modules.
3) Run 'NPM run start' to begin working. Sass will compile automatically when you work from sass/main.scss, and the browser will refresh automatically when you make changes.

Hopefully this will be of some use to someone.
